    Task: Create a BankAccount Class

    Objective:
    
    1. Create a BankAccount class with properties: accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance.

    3. Add methods:
    
    deposit(amount) - Increases the balance.
    
    withdraw(amount) - Decreases the balance if funds are sufficient.
    
    getAccountInfo() - Logs accountÂ details. -->
